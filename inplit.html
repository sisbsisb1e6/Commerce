            Solo Leveling (나 혼자만 레벨업, Na Honjaman Lebel-eob) “Solo Leveling Manhwa” or “Solo Leveling Manga” is a Korean webtoon series written by Chu-Gong and illustrated by Gi Si-Ryeong and Jang Su-Rak.“The Gate” arose ten years ago, bridging the gap between the actual world and the domain of magic and monsters. Ordinary humans were given superhuman abilities and were known as “Hunters” in order to confront these heinous animals. Sung Jin-Woo, a twenty-year-old Hunter, is renowned as the “World’s Weakest” due to his pitiful power when compared to even a meager E-Rank. Despite this, he continues to hunt monsters in low-rank Gates to help pay for his mother’s medical expenditures.However, Jin-terrible Woo’s life changes three days later when he awakens in a hospital to find a weird screen floating in front of him, believing himself to be the only one left to die in a mission gone horribly wrong. This “Quest Log” requires Jin-Woo to accomplish an unrealistic and rigorous training regimen.otherwise you’ll be subjected to the appropriate punishment. Jin-Woo is initially hesitant to agree due to the quest’s difficulty, but he soon realizes that it has the potential to turn him into one of the world’s most fearsome Hunters.
